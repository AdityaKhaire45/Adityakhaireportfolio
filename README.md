### Setting up Resend API on Vercel

1. Sign up for a [Resend](https://resend.com) account and get your API key
2. Go to your Vercel project settings
3. Navigate to the "Environment Variables" section
4. Add a new environment variable:

5. Save the changes and redeploy your application

Note: Make sure to keep your API key secret and never commit it to your repository.

## ⚠️ Required environment variables

The following environment variables must be set for the site to build and for the contact email API to work:

- `RESEND_API_KEY` — your Resend API key used by the serverless `/api/send` endpoint.

Add these in your Vercel project settings (or in a local `.env.local` for development) before building or deploying.
